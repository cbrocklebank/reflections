How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was easier to spot with only the differences showing

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having knowledge of when something changed and who changed it can provide
    insight

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual saving allows the programmer to choose logical commit points based on
    their standards. It does however require good discipline on the part of the
    individual.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Sometimes different files have interrelated changes. Building a program from
    a version that only included one of many dependent changes would fail.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Log helps to see the overall change history. Diff is used to see individual
    changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It's easier to find the change that broke something and subsequently fix it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    All of my projects.
