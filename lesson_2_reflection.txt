What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  The .git directory is added. Git won't track everything by default. It needs
  to be told what to track.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is a subset of data from the working directory to be
  committed to the repository. It should allow commits to target specific files,
  giving more options for granularity to the user.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

  The staging area can be compared to the repository's last commit to verify
  only one logical change is committed at a time.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

  Branches are good for changes that aren't ready to deploy. Experimental
  features can be tested without disrupting production code. If they work out,
  they can be merged.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

  They make it very clear what history you can see from any given commit. They
  also make it clear what changes you may be missing from a branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

  The features from both branches are present in the new tip. It is represented
  that way to show that the two branches have come together and merged into one
  branch containing all history of both.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

  Automatic merging covers most changes and saves a lot of time, however it
  could end up duplicating similar changes rather than merging. Always doing
  merges manually would take considerable time when dealing with a large code
  base.
